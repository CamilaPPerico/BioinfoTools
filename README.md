# gaGo: 
- Excencial of a Genetic Algorithm for Matlab or Gnu Octave

- Author: Prof. Dr. Roberto Tadeu Raittz. | 
Laboratory of Artificial Inteligence of the Bioinformatics Graduate Program UFPR/SEPT

- Runs a canonic (binary) genetic algorithm;

- Example:

      x = gaGo(@fitnessfunc, numberofbits, gaoptions);

x receives numberofbits bits optimized according to the user function 'fitnessfunc';

gaoptions is an struct compatible with that generated by Matlab gaoptimset or 

one struct var that contains at least the parameters:

       gaoptions.InitialPopulation
       gaoptions.PopulationSize
       gaoptions.Generations
       gaoptions.EliteCount
       gaoptions.MutationFcn
